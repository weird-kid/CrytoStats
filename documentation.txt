Synchronous Blocking:
-------------------

    So, say there are two requests A and B sent to a server.
    Traditional, one of them goes first. Say, A.
    Then, A's HTTP request is examined, if valid, its demands must be met by Server. And then Server carries
    out its own backend process to mean the demands.

    SO, meanwhile B request is stored in a queue, but blocked. It will get released as soon as A gets its response.
    So, each request is handled Sequentially, one after the other. There is not multitasking.
